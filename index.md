## Computers in Biology (MOLB4485/5485)

This repository is located at [github.com/cryptic0/CompBioCourse](https://github.com/cryptic0/CompBioCourse).  It contains archived versions of the modules I have developed for a cross-listed short course at the University of Wyoming.  So far I have taught this course for 4 years (2016-19), once a year during the Fall semester.
